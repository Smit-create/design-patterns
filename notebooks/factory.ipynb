    "# Factory Method Pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Factory Method Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It encapsulates the object creation logic, making it easier to manage and extend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In software development, there are scenarios where the exact type of object to be created may not be known until runtime or may vary based on certain conditions. The Factory Method Pattern addresses this by delegating the responsibility of object creation to subclasses, thereby promoting loose coupling between the creator and the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dive into the implementation of the Factory Method Pattern. In this pattern, we define an interface or abstract class for creating objects, and subclasses implement the factory method to create specific types of objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a real-life example of a Factory Method Pattern in a scenario where we have different types of employees being hired by a company.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Employee Hiring System\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you're developing a system for a company to hire different types of employees: full-time employees, part-time employees, and contractors. Each type of employee has different attributes and benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the Factory Method Pattern to create a flexible system for hiring different types of employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by defining an `Employee` interface or abstract class with a method `calculate_bonus`, which represents the bonus calculation for different types of employees."
